## About Pyriodicity
Pyriodicity provides intuitive and easy-to-use Python implementation for periodicity (seasonality) detection in univariate time series. Pyriodicity supports the following detection methods:
- [Autocorrelation Function (ACF)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/acf.html)
- [Autoperiod]( https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611972757.40)
- [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/useful-predictors.html#fourier-series)

## Installation
To install the latest version of `pyriodicity`, simply run:

```shell
pip install pyriodicity
```

## Example
Start by loading a the `co2` timeseries emissions sample data from [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org)
```python
from statsmodels.datasets import co2
data = co2.load().data
```

You can then resample the data to whatever frequency you want. In this example, we downsample the data to a monthly frequency
```python
data = data.resample("ME").mean().ffill()
```

Use `Autoperiod` to find the list of periods based in this data (if any).
```python
from pyriodicity import Autoperiod
autoperiod = Autoperiod(data)
periods = autoperiod.fit()
```

There are multiple parameters you can play with should you wish to. For example, you can specify a lower percentile value for a more lenient detection
```python
autoperiod.fit(percentile=90)
```

Or increase the number of random data permutations for a better power threshold estimation
```python
autoperiod.fit(k=300)
```

Alternatively, you can use other periodicity detection methods such as `ACFPeriodicityDetector` and `FFTPeriodicityDetector` and compare results and performances.

## Development Environment Setup
This project is built and published using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org). To setup a development environment for this project you can follow these steps:

1. Install one of the compatible [Python](https://www.python.org) versions indicated above.
2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx).
3. Navigate to the root folder and install dependencies in a virtual environment:
```shell
poetry install
```
4. If everything worked properly, you should have an environment under the name `pyriodicity-py3.*` activated. You can verify this by running:
```shell
poetry env list
```
5. You can run tests using the command:
```shell
poetry run pytest
```
6. To export the detailed dependency list, consider running the following:
```shell
# Add poetry-plugin-export plugin to poetry
poetry self add poetry-plugin-export

# Export the package dependencies to requirements.txt
poetry export --output requirements.txt

# If you wish to export all the dependencies, including those needed for testing, run the following command
poetry export --with test --output requirements-dev.txt
```
